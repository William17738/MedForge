Lecture 1: Cell Biology Fundamentals

Slide 1: Introduction to Cells
- Cells are the basic unit of life
- All organisms composed of cells
- Cell theory: all cells from pre-existing cells

Slide 2: Prokaryotes vs Eukaryotes
- Prokaryotes: No nucleus, no membrane-bound organelles
- Examples: Bacteria, Archaea
- Eukaryotes: Nucleus present, organelles present
- Examples: Animals, Plants, Fungi

Slide 3: Key Organelles
- Mitochondria: ATP production (cellular respiration)
- Ribosomes: Protein synthesis
- ER: Rough (proteins), Smooth (lipids)
- Golgi: Protein modification and packaging
- Lysosomes: Cellular digestion

Slide 4: Cell Membrane Structure
- Phospholipid bilayer
- Embedded proteins (channels, receptors)
- Selective permeability
- Fluid mosaic model

Lecture 2: Molecular Genetics

Slide 5: DNA Structure
- Double helix (Watson & Crick, 1953)
- Nucleotides: A-T, G-C base pairing
- Sugar-phosphate backbone
- Antiparallel strands

Slide 6: Central Dogma
- DNA -> DNA (Replication)
- DNA -> RNA (Transcription)
- RNA -> Protein (Translation)
- One-way flow of information

Slide 7: Types of Mutations
- Silent: No amino acid change
- Missense: One amino acid changed
- Nonsense: Premature stop codon
- Frameshift: Reading frame shifted

Slide 8: Gene Regulation
- Transcription factors
- Promoters and enhancers
- Epigenetic modifications
- Post-translational control

Lecture 3: Cell Division

Slide 9: Mitosis Overview
- Purpose: Growth and repair
- Result: 2 identical diploid cells
- Stages: PMAT (Prophase, Metaphase, Anaphase, Telophase)

Slide 10: Mitosis Stages Detail
- Prophase: Chromosomes condense
- Metaphase: Align at equator
- Anaphase: Chromatids separate
- Telophase: Nuclear envelope reforms

Slide 11: Meiosis Overview
- Purpose: Gamete production
- Result: 4 haploid cells
- Two divisions: Meiosis I and II
- Genetic diversity through crossing over

Slide 12: Cell Cycle Regulation
- Cyclins and CDKs control progression
- Checkpoints: G1, S, G2, M
- Ensure proper replication
- Cancer: checkpoint failure
