Chapter 1: Cell Biology

Cells are the fundamental units of life. All living organisms are composed of one or more cells, and all cells arise from pre-existing cells through cell division.

There are two main types of cells: prokaryotic and eukaryotic. Prokaryotic cells (bacteria and archaea) lack a membrane-bound nucleus and other organelles. Eukaryotic cells (plants, animals, fungi) contain a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles.

Key organelles in eukaryotic cells include:
- Mitochondria: The powerhouse of the cell, responsible for ATP production through cellular respiration
- Ribosomes: Sites of protein synthesis, found free in cytoplasm or attached to rough ER
- Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER): Rough ER processes proteins, smooth ER synthesizes lipids
- Golgi Apparatus: Modifies, packages, and ships proteins to their destinations
- Lysosomes: Contain digestive enzymes for breaking down cellular waste

The cell membrane is a phospholipid bilayer that regulates what enters and exits the cell. It contains embedded proteins that serve as channels, receptors, and transporters.

Chapter 2: Molecular Genetics

DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) stores genetic information in all living organisms. The structure of DNA is a double helix, discovered by Watson and Crick in 1953.

The Central Dogma of molecular biology describes the flow of genetic information:
- DNA replication: DNA -> DNA (copying genetic material before cell division)
- Transcription: DNA -> RNA (creating messenger RNA from DNA template)
- Translation: RNA -> Protein (ribosomes read mRNA to build proteins)

Mutations are changes in DNA sequence that can occur spontaneously or due to environmental factors:
- Silent mutations: No change in amino acid sequence
- Missense mutations: Single amino acid change
- Nonsense mutations: Premature stop codon, truncated protein
- Frameshift mutations: Insertion or deletion shifts reading frame

Gene expression is regulated at multiple levels including transcription factors, epigenetic modifications, and post-translational modifications.

Chapter 3: Cell Division

Cell division is essential for growth, repair, and reproduction. There are two main types:

Mitosis produces two identical daughter cells for growth and repair:
1. Prophase: Chromosomes condense, nuclear envelope breaks down
2. Metaphase: Chromosomes align at cell equator
3. Anaphase: Sister chromatids separate and move to poles
4. Telophase: Nuclear envelopes reform, chromosomes decondense
5. Cytokinesis: Cytoplasm divides

Meiosis produces four haploid gametes for sexual reproduction:
- Meiosis I: Homologous chromosomes separate (reduction division)
- Meiosis II: Sister chromatids separate (similar to mitosis)
- Crossing over during Prophase I creates genetic diversity

The cell cycle is regulated by cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). Checkpoints ensure proper DNA replication and chromosome segregation.
