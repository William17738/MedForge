### 1. Which organelle is primarily responsible for ATP production in eukaryotic cells?

- **A**. Ribosome
- **B**. Mitochondrion
- **C**. Golgi apparatus
- **D**. Lysosome

> **Answer**: B

**Explanation**: Mitochondria are known as the "powerhouse of the cell" because they are the primary site of ATP production through cellular respiration. The process involves:

1. **Glycolysis** (cytoplasm): Glucose → Pyruvate
2. **Krebs Cycle** (mitochondrial matrix): Pyruvate → CO2 + NADH/FADH2
3. **Electron Transport Chain** (inner membrane): NADH/FADH2 → ATP

**Why other options are incorrect**:
- A. Ribosomes synthesize proteins, not ATP
- C. Golgi apparatus modifies and packages proteins
- D. Lysosomes contain digestive enzymes for waste breakdown

### 2. What is the main structural difference between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells?

- **A**. Prokaryotes have a cell wall
- **B**. Eukaryotes lack ribosomes
- **C**. Prokaryotes lack a membrane-bound nucleus
- **D**. Eukaryotes are always unicellular

> **Answer**: C

**Explanation**: The defining characteristic of prokaryotic cells is the **absence of a membrane-bound nucleus**. Their genetic material (DNA) is located in a region called the nucleoid, which is not enclosed by a membrane.

**Key differences**:
| Feature | Prokaryotes | Eukaryotes |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Nucleus | No membrane | Membrane-bound |
| Size | 1-10 μm | 10-100 μm |
| Organelles | None | Present |
| Examples | Bacteria | Animals, Plants |

**Why other options are incorrect**:
- A. Both can have cell walls (plants are eukaryotes with cell walls)
- B. Both have ribosomes (though different sizes: 70S vs 80S)
- D. Many eukaryotes are unicellular (e.g., yeast, amoeba)

### 3. The rough endoplasmic reticulum is characterized by:

- **A**. Lipid synthesis activity
- **B**. Attached ribosomes
- **C**. ATP production
- **D**. Waste digestion

> **Answer**: B

**Explanation**: The rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) gets its "rough" appearance from **ribosomes attached to its surface**. These ribosomes synthesize proteins that are destined for:
- Secretion outside the cell
- Insertion into membranes
- Use in lysosomes

**Comparison**:
- **Rough ER**: Ribosomes attached → Protein synthesis and processing
- **Smooth ER**: No ribosomes → Lipid synthesis, detoxification

### 4. Which component of the cell membrane allows selective permeability?

- **A**. Cholesterol only
- **B**. Phospholipid bilayer with embedded proteins
- **C**. Carbohydrate chains
- **D**. Cytoskeleton attachments

> **Answer**: B

**Explanation**: Selective permeability is achieved through the **phospholipid bilayer combined with embedded proteins**:

- **Phospholipid bilayer**: Hydrophobic core blocks most polar molecules
- **Channel proteins**: Allow specific ions to pass
- **Carrier proteins**: Transport specific molecules via conformational changes
- **Aquaporins**: Facilitate water movement

This is described by the **Fluid Mosaic Model** (Singer & Nicolson, 1972).

### 5. In the central dogma of molecular biology, transcription converts:

- **A**. RNA to protein
- **B**. DNA to RNA
- **C**. Protein to DNA
- **D**. RNA to DNA

> **Answer**: B

**Explanation**: The Central Dogma describes the flow of genetic information:

```
DNA  --[Replication]-->  DNA
 |
 +--[Transcription]-->  RNA  --[Translation]-->  Protein
```

**Transcription** is the process where DNA serves as a template to synthesize messenger RNA (mRNA). This occurs in the nucleus and is catalyzed by **RNA polymerase**.

### 6. A mutation that results in a premature stop codon is called:

- **A**. Silent mutation
- **B**. Missense mutation
- **C**. Nonsense mutation
- **D**. Frameshift mutation

> **Answer**: C

**Explanation**: A **nonsense mutation** creates a premature stop codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA), resulting in a truncated, usually non-functional protein.

**Mutation types comparison**:
| Type | Effect | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| Silent | No AA change | GCU → GCC (both = Ala) |
| Missense | Different AA | GAG → GUG (Glu → Val) |
| Nonsense | Stop codon | UAU → UAA (Tyr → STOP) |
| Frameshift | Shifted reading | Insertion/deletion |

### 7. Which of the following is NOT a component of DNA?

- **A**. Adenine
- **B**. Uracil
- **C**. Phosphate group
- **D**. Deoxyribose sugar

> **Answer**: B

**Explanation**: **Uracil is found in RNA, not DNA**. DNA contains thymine instead.

**DNA vs RNA bases**:
- DNA: Adenine, Guanine, Cytosine, **Thymine**
- RNA: Adenine, Guanine, Cytosine, **Uracil**

DNA components: Deoxyribose sugar + Phosphate group + Nitrogenous base (A/T/G/C)

### 8. The structure of DNA was discovered by:

- **A**. Mendel and Morgan
- **B**. Watson and Crick
- **C**. Darwin and Wallace
- **D**. Pasteur and Koch

> **Answer**: B

**Explanation**: **James Watson and Francis Crick** proposed the double helix structure of DNA in 1953, based on:
- X-ray crystallography data from Rosalind Franklin
- Chargaff's rules (A=T, G=C)

They received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1962.

### 9. During which phase of mitosis do chromosomes align at the cell's equator?

- **A**. Prophase
- **B**. Metaphase
- **C**. Anaphase
- **D**. Telophase

> **Answer**: B

**Explanation**: During **metaphase**, chromosomes align at the **metaphase plate** (cell equator). This ensures equal distribution of genetic material to daughter cells.

**Mitosis stages (PMAT)**:
1. **P**rophase: Chromosomes condense
2. **M**etaphase: Align at equator ← **Answer**
3. **A**naphase: Sister chromatids separate
4. **T**elophase: Nuclear envelope reforms

### 10. Meiosis differs from mitosis in that meiosis:

- **A**. Produces identical daughter cells
- **B**. Results in four haploid cells
- **C**. Does not involve DNA replication
- **D**. Only occurs in prokaryotes

> **Answer**: B

**Explanation**: Meiosis produces **four haploid (n) daughter cells** for sexual reproduction, while mitosis produces two diploid (2n) cells.

| Feature | Mitosis | Meiosis |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Divisions | 1 | 2 |
| Daughter cells | 2 diploid | 4 haploid |
| Genetic variation | No | Yes (crossing over) |
| Purpose | Growth/repair | Gamete production |

---

### 11. Crossing over occurs during which stage of meiosis?

- **A**. Metaphase I
- **B**. Prophase I
- **C**. Anaphase II
- **D**. Telophase II

> **Answer**: B

**Explanation**: **Crossing over** occurs during **Prophase I** of meiosis, when homologous chromosomes pair up and exchange genetic material. This creates genetic diversity in offspring.

The process involves:
1. Homologous chromosomes pair (synapsis)
2. Non-sister chromatids exchange segments
3. Results in recombinant chromosomes

---

### 12. Cell cycle checkpoints are regulated by:

- **A**. Mitochondria and chloroplasts
- **B**. Cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases
- **C**. Ribosomes and lysosomes
- **D**. Histones and nucleosomes

> **Answer**: B

**Explanation**: **Cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs)** regulate cell cycle progression through checkpoints:

- **G1 checkpoint**: Cell size, nutrients, DNA damage
- **S checkpoint**: DNA replication complete
- **G2 checkpoint**: DNA replication errors
- **M checkpoint**: Chromosome attachment to spindle

Failure of these checkpoints can lead to **cancer** (uncontrolled cell division).
