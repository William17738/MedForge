## Lecture 1: Cell Biology Fundamentals

### Key Insights
- Cells are the basic structural and functional units of all living organisms
- Understanding cell structure is fundamental to medicine and biotechnology
- The distinction between prokaryotes and eukaryotes is clinically relevant (antibiotics target prokaryotic features)

---

### 1.1 Introduction to Cells

**Core Concepts**

**Cell Theory** states three fundamental principles:
1. All living organisms are composed of one or more cells
2. The cell is the basic unit of life
3. All cells arise from pre-existing cells through division

> *From textbook*: "Cells are the fundamental units of life. All living organisms are composed of one or more cells."

### 1.2 Prokaryotes vs Eukaryotes *

| Feature | Prokaryotes | Eukaryotes |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Nucleus** | No membrane-bound nucleus | Membrane-bound nucleus |
| **Size** | 1-10 μm | 10-100 μm |
| **Organelles** | None (except ribosomes) | Multiple membrane-bound |
| **DNA** | Circular, in nucleoid | Linear, in nucleus |
| **Examples** | Bacteria, Archaea | Animals, Plants, Fungi |

! **Clinical relevance**: Many antibiotics (e.g., penicillin) target prokaryotic-specific features like cell wall synthesis, making them selective against bacteria without harming human cells.

---

### 1.3 Key Organelles *

**Mitochondria - The Powerhouse**
- Primary function: ATP production through cellular respiration
- Contains own DNA (maternal inheritance)
- Double membrane structure
- Clinical: Mitochondrial diseases affect high-energy tissues (muscle, brain)

**Ribosomes - Protein Factories**
- Site of protein synthesis (translation)
- Two types: Free (cytoplasmic proteins) and Bound (secreted/membrane proteins)
- Prokaryotic: 70S | Eukaryotic: 80S

**Endoplasmic Reticulum**
| Type | Features | Function |
|------|----------|----------|
| Rough ER | Ribosomes attached | Protein synthesis & processing |
| Smooth ER | No ribosomes | Lipid synthesis, detoxification |

**Golgi Apparatus**
- Receives proteins from ER
- Modifies, sorts, and packages
- Ships to correct destination (secretion, membrane, lysosome)

**Lysosomes**
- Contains digestive enzymes (hydrolases)
- Breaks down cellular waste and foreign material
- pH ~5 (acidic environment)

### 1.4 Cell Membrane Structure

**Fluid Mosaic Model** (Singer & Nicolson, 1972)

```
     Extracellular
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    ○○○○○○○○○○○○○○○○  ← Phospholipid heads (hydrophilic)
    ||||||||||||||||  ← Fatty acid tails (hydrophobic)
    ||||||||||||||||
    ○○○○○○○○○○○○○○○○
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     Intracellular

    [Proteins embedded throughout]
```

**Components**:
- **Phospholipid bilayer**: Forms basic structure
- **Integral proteins**: Channels, carriers, receptors
- **Peripheral proteins**: Attached to surface
- **Cholesterol**: Membrane fluidity regulation
- **Glycoproteins/Glycolipids**: Cell recognition

**Selective Permeability**:
- Small nonpolar molecules: Pass freely
- Small polar molecules: Limited passage
- Large molecules/ions: Require transport proteins

## Lecture 2: Molecular Genetics

### Key Insights
- DNA stores genetic information in a remarkably stable structure
- The Central Dogma explains how genetic information flows
- Understanding mutations is crucial for genetics and oncology

---

### 2.1 DNA Structure *

**Double Helix** (Watson & Crick, 1953)

Key features:
- Two antiparallel strands (5' → 3' and 3' → 5')
- Sugar-phosphate backbone on outside
- Base pairs on inside (hydrogen bonds)
- Base pairing rules: **A-T** (2 H-bonds), **G-C** (3 H-bonds)

> *Historical note*: Structure determined using X-ray crystallography data from Rosalind Franklin and Chargaff's rules.

### 2.2 Central Dogma *

```
              Replication
                  ↓
    +--------+   DNA   +--------+
    |        |    ↓    |        |
    |        | Transcription    |
    |        |    ↓    |        |
    |        |   RNA   |        |
    |        |    ↓    |        |
    |        | Translation      |
    |        |    ↓    |        |
    +--------+ Protein +--------+
```

| Process | Template | Product | Location | Enzyme |
|---------|----------|---------|----------|--------|
| Replication | DNA | DNA | Nucleus | DNA Polymerase |
| Transcription | DNA | RNA | Nucleus | RNA Polymerase |
| Translation | mRNA | Protein | Ribosome | - |

### 2.3 Mutation Types *

**Point Mutations**:

| Type | Definition | Example | Effect |
|------|------------|---------|--------|
| **Silent** | Codon change, same AA | GCU→GCC (both Ala) | None |
| **Missense** | Codon change, different AA | GAG→GUG (Glu→Val) | Variable |
| **Nonsense** | Creates stop codon | UAU→UAA (Tyr→Stop) | Truncated protein |

**Frameshift Mutations**:
- Caused by insertions or deletions (not multiples of 3)
- Shifts entire reading frame downstream
- Usually results in nonfunctional protein

! **Clinical example**: Sickle cell anemia is caused by a single missense mutation (Glu→Val in β-globin).

## Lecture 3: Cell Division

### Key Insights
- Mitosis maintains genetic stability during growth
- Meiosis creates genetic diversity for evolution
- Cell cycle dysregulation leads to cancer

---

### 3.1 Mitosis Overview *

**Purpose**: Growth, repair, asexual reproduction

**Result**: 2 genetically identical diploid cells

**Stages (PMAT)**:

| Stage | Key Events |
|-------|------------|
| **Prophase** | Chromatin condenses, nuclear envelope breaks down, spindle forms |
| **Metaphase** | Chromosomes align at metaphase plate (equator) |
| **Anaphase** | Sister chromatids separate, move to opposite poles |
| **Telophase** | Nuclear envelopes reform, chromosomes decondense |
| **Cytokinesis** | Cytoplasm divides (cleavage furrow in animals) |

---

### 3.2 Meiosis Overview *

**Purpose**: Produce haploid gametes for sexual reproduction

**Result**: 4 genetically unique haploid cells

**Two Divisions**:

| | Meiosis I | Meiosis II |
|-|-----------|------------|
| Type | Reductional | Equational |
| Separates | Homologous chromosomes | Sister chromatids |
| Result | 2 haploid cells | 4 haploid cells |

**Crossing Over** (Prophase I):
- Homologous chromosomes pair up (synapsis)
- Non-sister chromatids exchange segments
- Creates recombinant chromosomes → genetic diversity

---

### 3.3 Comparison Table *

| Feature | Mitosis | Meiosis |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Number of divisions | 1 | 2 |
| Daughter cells | 2 | 4 |
| Ploidy of products | Diploid (2n) | Haploid (n) |
| Genetic variation | No | Yes |
| Crossing over | No | Yes (Prophase I) |
| Purpose | Growth, repair | Gamete production |
| Occurs in | Somatic cells | Germ cells |

---

### 3.4 Cell Cycle Regulation

**Key Regulators**:
- **Cyclins**: Proteins that fluctuate during cell cycle
- **CDKs**: Cyclin-dependent kinases (activated by cyclins)
- Together they control checkpoint passage

**Checkpoints**:
| Checkpoint | Location | Checks For |
|------------|----------|------------|
| G1 | End of G1 | Cell size, nutrients, growth signals, DNA damage |
| S | During S | Replication errors |
| G2 | End of G2 | Complete replication, DNA damage |
| M | Metaphase | Proper spindle attachment |

! **Cancer connection**: Mutations in checkpoint genes (e.g., p53, Rb) allow uncontrolled cell division.
