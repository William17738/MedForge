## Part 1: Chapter Overview

This chapter covers fundamental concepts in cell biology, molecular genetics, and cell division. These topics form the foundation of modern biology and are essential for understanding how living organisms function at the cellular and molecular level. Mastery of these concepts is critical for advanced study in biochemistry, genetics, and medicine.

## Part 2: Key Concepts

### Cell Biology

**Cell Types** *
- **Prokaryotic cells**: No membrane-bound nucleus, no organelles (bacteria, archaea)
- **Eukaryotic cells**: Membrane-bound nucleus, organelles present (animals, plants, fungi)

**Key Organelles** *
| Organelle | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| Mitochondria | ATP production (cellular respiration) |
| Ribosomes | Protein synthesis |
| Rough ER | Protein processing (has ribosomes) |
| Smooth ER | Lipid synthesis |
| Golgi apparatus | Protein modification and packaging |
| Lysosomes | Cellular digestion |

**Cell Membrane** *
- Phospholipid bilayer with embedded proteins
- Selective permeability (fluid mosaic model)
- Functions: transport, signaling, cell recognition

! **Common mistake**: Confusing rough and smooth ER functions. Remember: Rough = Ribosomes = pRoteins

### Molecular Genetics

**Central Dogma** *
```
DNA → RNA → Protein
    ↑         ↑
Transcription Translation
```

**DNA Structure**
- Double helix (Watson & Crick, 1953)
- Base pairing: A-T, G-C
- Antiparallel strands (5' to 3')

**Mutation Types** *
| Type | Effect | Clinical Relevance |
|------|--------|-------------------|
| Silent | No amino acid change | Usually benign |
| Missense | Single AA change | Variable effects |
| Nonsense | Premature stop codon | Often severe |
| Frameshift | Shifted reading frame | Usually severe |

! **Common mistake**: Confusing uracil (RNA) with thymine (DNA)

### Cell Division

**Mitosis** (PMAT) *
1. **Prophase**: Chromosomes condense
2. **Metaphase**: Align at equator
3. **Anaphase**: Chromatids separate
4. **Telophase**: Nuclear envelope reforms

**Meiosis** *
- Two divisions (Meiosis I and II)
- Produces 4 haploid cells
- Crossing over in Prophase I creates diversity

**Comparison Table** *
| Feature | Mitosis | Meiosis |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Divisions | 1 | 2 |
| Products | 2 diploid | 4 haploid |
| Purpose | Growth | Reproduction |
| Variation | No | Yes |

**Cell Cycle Regulation**
- Cyclins + CDKs control checkpoints
- G1, S, G2, M checkpoints
- Failure → Cancer

! **Common mistake**: Forgetting that crossing over occurs in Prophase I, not Metaphase I
