## Part 1: Chapter Overview

This chapter covers fundamental concepts in cell biology, molecular genetics, 
and cell division. These topics form the foundation of modern biology.

## Part 2: Key Concepts

- Chapter 1: Cell Biology Cells are the fundamental units of life.
- Key organelles in eukaryotic cells include: - Mitochondria: The powerhouse of the cell, responsible for ATP production through cellular respiration - Ribosomes: Sites of protein synthesis, found free in cytoplasm or attached to rough ER - Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER): Rough ER processes proteins, smooth ER synthesizes lipids - Golgi Apparatus: Modifies, packages, and ships proteins to their destinations - Lysosomes: Contain digestive enzymes for breaking down cellular waste The cell membrane is a phospholipid bilayer that regulates what enters and exits the cell.
- It contains embedded proteins that serve as channels, receptors, and transporters.
- Chapter 3: Cell Division Cell division is essential for growth, repair, and reproduction.
- There are two main types: Mitosis produces two identical daughter cells for growth and repair: 1.
- Cytokinesis: Cytoplasm divides Meiosis produces four haploid gametes for sexual reproduction: - Meiosis I: Homologous chromosomes separate (reduction division) - Meiosis II: Sister chromatids separate (similar to mitosis) - Crossing over during Prophase I creates genetic diversity The cell cycle is regulated by cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs).
